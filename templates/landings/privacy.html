      <p>Your privacy is critically important to us. At Hello! Base we have a few fundamental principles:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>We don’t ask you for personal information unless we truly need it. (We can’t stand services that ask you for things like your gender or income level for no apparent reason.)</li>
        <li>We don’t share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights.</li>
        <li>We don’t store personal information on our servers unless required for the on-going operation of one of our services.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Below is our privacy policy which incorporates these goals:</p>
      <p>Revyver Inc. (“Revyver") operates <a href="{% url "site-home" %}">hello-base.com</a>. It is Revyver's policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our websites.</p>

      <h2>Website Visitors</h2>
      <p>Like most website operators, Revyver collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Revyver’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Revyver’s visitors use its website. From time to time, Revyver may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>
      <p>Revyver also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on Hello! Base properties. Revyver only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below.

      <h2>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
      <p>Certain visitors to Revyver’s websites choose to interact with Revyver in ways that require Revyver to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Revyver gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up at <a href="{% url "site-home" %}">hello-base.com</a> to provide a username and email address. Those who engage in transactions with Revyver – by purchasing access to the Akismet comment spam prevention service, for example – are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, Revyver collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with Revyver. Revyver does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.</p>

      <h2>Aggregated Statistics</h2>
      <p>Revyver may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. Revyver may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, Revyver does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.</p>

      <h2>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying information</h2>
      <p>Revyver discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Revyver’s behalf or to provide services available at Revyver’s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Revyver’s websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Revyver will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Revyver discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when Revyver believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Revyver, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of a Revyver website and have supplied your email address, Revyver may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with Revyver and our products. We primarily use our various product blogs to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Revyver takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.</p>

      <h2>Cookies</h2>
      <p>A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Revyver uses cookies to help Revyver identify and track visitors, their usage of Revyver website, and their website access preferences. Revyver visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using Revyver’s websites, with the drawback that certain features of Revyver’s websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.</p>

      <h2>Business Transfers</h2>
      <p>If Revyver, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, or in the unlikely event that Revyver goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of Revyver may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.</p>

      <h2>Ads</h2>
      <p>Ads appearing on any of our websites may be delivered to users by advertising partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to compile information about you or others who use your computer. This information allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by Revyver and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.</p>

      <h2>Privacy Policy Changes</h2>
      <p>Although most changes are likely to be minor, Revyver may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in Revyver’s sole discretion. Revyver encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.</p>
